# Keezer
Temperature controller for the Keezer project

Control the temperature in a freezer using an Adafruit Feather Huzzah (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821), Adafruit FeatherWing OLED (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2900), PowerSwitch Tail (https://www.adafruit.com/product/268), and a Dallas Temperature sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/381).

The current temperature is displayed on the OLED, along with the target and current status (on/off).
There is a very simple web interface to see the current temperature as well as set the target temperature.
